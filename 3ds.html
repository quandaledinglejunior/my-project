        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Face-Tracking 3D</h3>
          <p>
            The face-tracking feature uses the system’s inner cameras to adjust
            images based on your viewing angle, so you can enjoy total immersion
            in your games.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Improved Controls</h3>
          <p>
            The C stick brings added control possibilities (like intuitive

        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>More Power</h3>
          <p>
            Improved CPU performance means faster loading times, so you spend
            more time playing. Many games will look and play better and several
            upcoming games will be built from the ground up to take advantage of
            this power boost.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Play More Games</h3>
          <p>
            You can still play all Nintendo 3DS games and nearly all games from
            previous systems such as Nintendo DS and DSi. And, some future
            titles will be exclusively playable on this 2015 version of Nintendo
            3DS XL.

            with ease. You can even use the ZL/ZR buttons to switch tabs or zoom
            in with the C stick. You can browse the web right from your 3DS XL
            from anywhere with a wireless Wi-Fi network. You can pause your game
            at any point to search a website for game hints or catch up with
            email and news.

          <h3>3D Screen</h3>
          <p>
            The Nintendo 3DS XL system features a stereoscopic 3D display on the
            top screen to give objects within the game world a feeling of space
            and depth. It becomes easier to see the position of characters and
            obstacles, making many game experiences even more intuitive for all
            types of players.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>3D Depth Slider</h3>

            effect can also be turned down completely. All Nintendo 3DS games
            and applications can also be played in 2D.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>3D Camera</h3>
          <p>
            The Nintendo 3DS XL system can take photos in 3D, thanks to the two
            outward-facing lenses. Capture eye-popping images of your friends
            and family, have fun with filters like the Merge lens, or even use
            the system’s AR technology and included AR Cards to make Mii
            characters and Nintendo heroes appear in the real world with you.
            You can share your 3D photos with others by submitting them to the
            Nintendo 3DS Photo Showcase. Browse featured galleries or submit
            your own masterpiece to the Showcase. In a creative mood? You can
            record your own 3D videos, or 3D stop-motion animation using the
            built-in 3D camera.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Motion Sensor & Gyro Sensor</h3>
          <p>
            Portable play controls allow for unique gameplay mechanics. A
            built-in motion sensor and gyro sensor can react to the motion and
            tilt of the system, so whether players are twisting their systems
            side to side or moving them up and down, their motion-compatible
            Nintendo 3DS games respond instantly.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">

            traditional buttons, camera and microphone input, and advanced
            motion control of the Motion Sensor and Gyro Sensor, the Nintendo
            3DS XL provides a variety of ways to interact and play.

          <h3>Two Screens</h3>
          <p>
            On the Nintendo 3DS XL, a widescreen display on the top screen shows
            an 800 x 240 pixel resolution, allocating 400 pixels for each eye to
            create the 3D effect. The bottom LCD touch screen operates at a 320
            x 240 resolution. Both screens are capable of displaying a brilliant
            16.77 million colors.

            Almost all existing Nintendo DS and Nintendo DSi games can be played
            on the Nintendo 3DS family of systems in 2D. With backward
            compatibility, your existing portable games look and play just as
            well. If you’ve downloaded Nintendo DSiWare games and applications
            on your Nintendo DSi system, you can transfer most of those games to
            the Nintendo 3DS XL. You can also transfer downloaded software,
            sounds, and images between systems in the Nintendo 3DS family. Some
            games cannot be transferred. See the full list on Nintendo’s
            official website.
