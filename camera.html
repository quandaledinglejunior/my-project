        <h2>Product Description</h2>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Peerless Performance. Exceptional Versatility.</h3>
          <p>
            With a premium industrial design and an Ultra-HD imaging system, the
            Rally Camera tops the lineup of standalone video cameras from
            Logitech®. Packed with advanced optics and breakthrough
            technologies, Rally Camera delivers premium performance in
            professional meeting spaces of all shapes and sizes. Featuring
            whisper-quiet mechanical Pan/Tilt/Zoom, razor-sharp 15X HD zoom, an
            expansive 90° diagonal field of view, and a powerful 4K sensor,
            Rally Camera captures every person in the room with truly phenomenal
            video quality.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Studio-Quality Video</h3>
          <p>
            With an Ultra-HD imaging system, Rally Camera delivers brilliantly
            sharp video, outstanding color, and exceptional optical accuracy at
            resolutions up to 4K. Logitech RightLight™ technology optimizes
            light balance to emphasize faces and render natural-looking skin
            tones, even in dim or backlit conditions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Sleek Industrial Design</h3>
          <p>
            Rally Camera incorporates world-class Logitech optics and a 4K
            sensor in a premium industrial design suitable for any professional
            setting. Elegantly finished in matte black with slate gray metal
            trim, Rally Camera can be positioned on a table, mounted on a
            tripod, or secured to a wall with included hardware. For overhead
            installations, the camera detects when it’s inverted and
            automatically corrects image orientation and camera controls.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>See Everyone, Perfectly Framed</h3>
          <p>
            Logitech RightSight™ camera control automatically moves and adjusts
            the lens to comfortably frame meeting participants in rooms of all
            shapes and sizes.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Available for:</strong> Windows® 10 and macOS®</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Enhanced User Experience</h3>
          <p>
            Logitech RightSense is a suite of proactive technologies built into
            Rally Camera that automate a better user experience. RightSight
            automates camera control to perfectly frame participants, no matter
            their distance from the lens. RightLight optimizes light balance and
            prioritizes faces over objects and surfaces to render
            natural-looking skin tones. Plus, Rally Camera is compatible with
            virtually any video conferencing app right out of the box.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Privacy Assurance</h3>
          <p>
            When Rally Camera is not in use, the lens defaults to a parked
            position where the lens is pointed straight down. This provides
            visual affirmation that the camera is unable to “see” anything in
            the meeting space when idle. The lens lifts to a preset position
            when joining a meeting and parks automatically when the meeting
            ends. In addition, whenever video is muted during a meeting, a
            status light illuminates red to affirm visual privacy.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Automatic Camera Control</h3>
          <p>
            Logitech RightSight camera control technology automatically moves
            and adjusts the lens to comfortably frame meeting participants in
            rooms of all shapes and sizes. Enjoy hands-free convenience or take
            manual control: participants are always in view and optimally
            pictured on-screen.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Light/Color Optimization</h3>
          <p>
            Logitech RightLight technology with Wide Dynamic Range (WDR)
            prioritizes faces over objects and surfaces, optimizes light
            balance, and fine-tunes color and saturation for natural results
            across all skin tones. The result is a balanced image that renders
            participants in flattering light with reduced glare and softer
            shadows, even in dim or backlit conditions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Adaptive Pan, Tilt, and Zoom</h3>
          <p>
            Whisper-quiet mechanical PTZ motor adjusts pan and tilt speed with
            the amount of zoom. The result: Faster camera movement when zoomed
            out for quick framing and slower camera movement when zoomed in for
            more control.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>Multiple Installation Options</h3>
          <p>
            Position Rally Camera on a table, wall mount with included hardware,
            or attach to a VESA-compatible display with the optional TV Mount
            for MeetUp. For ceiling installations, Rally Camera detects when
            it’s inverted and automatically corrects the image orientation and
            camera controls. Rally Camera also includes a standard tripod thread
            for added flexibility.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
          <h3>4K Recording and Streaming</h3>
          <p>
            Rally Camera captures up to 4K video at up to 30 frames per second,
            ideal for Ultra HD recording and streaming. The advanced 4K imaging
            system delivers spectacular quality at all HD and Ultra HD
            resolutions with brilliantly sharp video, outstanding color
            reproduction, and exceptional optical accuracy.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature">
